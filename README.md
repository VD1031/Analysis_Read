# Linear Regression Project
Description

A Python script that performs Linear regression analysis which used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scipy
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)

You can install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scipy
cd data-analysis-project
```

# Running the Tests
Breakdown of Tests
The script includes:

linear regression is a model that estimates the linear relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables.

Data cleaning and preparation steps.

Statistical summary of the dataset.

A Python script that performs data analysis on agriculture water intake data, including hypothesis testing using a z-test.

# Deployment
This project is intended to be run locally in a Python environment. Optionally, you can run it inside Jupyter Notebook for better interactivity.
