# Linear Regression Project
Description

A Python script that performs Linear regression analysis which used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable.
# I have attched Linear assignment file 
which predicts laptop prices based on key feature such as RAM,battery life,storage,resolution,screen size and price.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scipy
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)

You can install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scipy
cd data-analysis-project
```

# Running the Tests
Breakdown of Tests
The script includes:

linear regression is a model that estimates the linear relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables.

Data cleaning and preparation steps.

# Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering
1.	Handling Missing Values: The dataset was checked for missing values. No significant missing data was found.
2.	Converted storage capacity to a numeric format (GB).
3.	Split screen resolution into two separate features: resolution width and resolution height
 # Data Splitting
The cleaned dataset was split into training and testing sets:
•	Training Set: 70% of the data
•	Testing Set: 30% of the data

# Statistical summary of the dataset.

A Python script that performs data analysis on agriculture water intake data, including hypothesis testing using a z-test.

# Interpretation of Results
A lower MSE(Mean Square error) suggests that the model's predictions are closer to actual values.
# Deployment
This project is intended to be run locally in a Python environment. Optionally, you can run it inside Jupyter Notebook for better interactivity.
